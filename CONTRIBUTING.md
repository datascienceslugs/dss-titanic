## Code Styling

Be consistent with the official styling guidelines found [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#when-to-use-trailing-commas). This not only vastly improves code readability but also helps avoid merge conflicts and bugs (Python is *very* sensitive to incorrect indentation!).
**tdlr;**
-Use 4 spaces for indentation (set your tab in VS Code to produces 4 spaces). This is **required** in Python 3.x.
-one statement per line
-avoid useless comments like "Increment X"
-Naming:
    - modules: all-lowercase
    - class: CapWords 
    - type variables: CapWords
    - functions and varibles: all-lowecase, words seperated by undescore
    - non-public methoods nad variables: same except use one leading underscore
    - constants: all caps
